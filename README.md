# Twitter in Postgres

You will repeat the Twitter/MapReduce assignment using Postgres.
Because this assignment will involve many new programming concepts,
it will be spread out over several assignments.

In this first assignment, we will focus on:
1. inserting data into the database
1. understanding denormalized vs normalized schemas
1. NoSQL vs SQL
